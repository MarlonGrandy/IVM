Ever since I was eight years old, I have been making trips to the Pine Barrens, and last spring I went there every day in search of land to buy to make my work. I was captivated by the landscape, yet I was unable to find an available site suitable for my sculpture. However, I was determined to bring a sense of that place to other places by filming different aspects of the land without any people in it, so that the landscape could no longer be seen as a mere backdrop for human activity, but rather it could begin to assert its own presence. Similarly, I wanted to make a film that would unfold intrinsically from the place and its inhabitants, rather than relying on explanatory narration by “voices of authority.” This attitude is being replaced by the new landscape of abstraction and artifice, where art is no longer an architectural afterthought, but rather a total engagement with the building process from the ground up and from the sky down."

As the aircraft ascends into higher and higher altitudes and flies at faster speeds, its meaning as an object changes—one could even say reverses. The streamlined design of our earlier aircraft becomes increasingly more truncated and angular. Our whole notion of airflight is casting off the old meaning of speed through space, and developing a new meaning based on instantaneous time. The aircraft no longer “represents” a bird or animal (the flying tigers) in an organic way, because the movement of air around the craft is no longer visible. The meaning of airflight has for the most part been conditioned by a rationalism that supposes truths—such as nature, progress, and speed. Such meanings are merely “categorical” and have no basis in actual fact. The same condition exists in art, if one sees the art through the rational categories of “painting, sculpture and architecture.” The rationalist sees only the details and never the whole. The categories that proceed from rational logic inflate a linguistic detail into a dated system of meaning, so that we cannot see the aircraft through the “speed.” Language problems are often at the bottom of most rationalistic “objectivity.” One must be conscious of the changes in language, before one attempts to discover the form of an object or fact."".

The Pine Barrens, a place of great mystery and intrigue, has been a source of inspiration for me since I was eight years old. Last spring, I made daily trips there in search of the perfect spot to create my sculpture. Although I was unable to find the ideal location, the land itself was captivating and I felt compelled to bring a sense of its essence to other places. I decided to do this by filming the land without any human presence, allowing the landscape to take center stage instead of being a mere backdrop for human activity. I also wanted the Pineys to tell their stories without my voice-over, as documentaries often rely too heavily on the ""voices of authority"" and a false sense of objectivity. This same condition exists in art, where the meaning of an object or fact can be distorted by rationalistic ""categories"" and language problems. To avoid this, I must be conscious of the changes in language and discover the form of the object or fact through a holistic approach, much like the aircraft which no longer ""represents"" birds or animals in an organic way due to its faster speeds and higher altitudes. The Pine Barrens has taught me that the meaning of an object or fact is not limited to rationalistic categories, and I hope to continue to explore this concept through my art."

The future air terminal, with its straight lines of landing fields and runways, suggests the infinite in a finite way, and aerial photography and air transportation bring into view the abstract and illusive world seen from the air, with its drastic changes of scale, from the dazzling to the monotonous. The naturalism of past art is replaced by a non-objective sense of site, and the landscape begins to look more like a three dimensional map than a rustic garden, with its rational structures of buildings disappearing into irrational disguises and optical illusions.

Drills and explosives that can produce shafts and earthquakes. Geometrical trenches could be dug with the help of the “ripper”—steel toothed rakes mounted on tractors.

Oxidation, hydration, carbonatization, and solution (the major processes of rock and mineral disintegration) are four methods that could be turned toward the making of art.

Weaving the details of both texts together, I began by shooting a few rolls of film with my Bolex in the Pine Barrens, and perceived the place at one remove. I had been shooting film in the landscape since 1968, and some of my ideas were at work in the Barrens, while the Barrens continuously re-involving me and giving me a flow of new film ideas. I kept to the same pattern—filming one day and looking at rushes the next day in New York—which made both places emerge in my mind in a very focused and detached way. This idea of detachment is evident in the aircraft, as its streamlined design becomes increasingly more truncated and angular, casting off the old meaning of speed through space and developing a new meaning based on instantaneous time. The meaning of airflight has been conditioned by a rationalism that supposes truths, but such meanings are merely “categorical” and have no basis in actual fact.

Even the most advanced tools and machines are made of the raw matter of the earth. Today’s highly refined technological tools are not much different in this respect from those of the caveman. Most of the better artists prefer processes that have not been idealized, or differentiated into “objective” meanings. Common shovels, awkward looking excavating devices, what Michael Heizer calls “dumb tools,” picks, pitchforks, the machine used by suburban contractors, grim tractors that have the clumsiness of armored dinosaurs, and plows that simply push dirt around. Machines like Benjamin Holt’s steam tractor (invented in 1885)—“It crawls over mud like a caterpillar.” Digging engines and other crawlers that can travel over rough terrain and steep grades. Drills and explosives that can produce shafts and earthquakes. Geometrical trenches could be dug with the help of the “ripper”—steel toothed rakes mounted on tractors. With such equipment construction takes on the look of destruction; perhaps that’s why certain architects hate bulldozers and steam shovels. They seem to turn the terrain into unfinished cities of organized wreckage. A sense of chaotic planning engulfs site after site. Subdivisions are made—but to what purpose? Building takes on a singular wildness as loaders scoop and drag soil all over the place. Excavations form shapeless mounds of debris, miniature landslides of dust, mud, sand and gravel. Dump trucks spill soil into an infinity of heaps. The dipper of the giant mining power shovel is 25 feet high and digs 140 cu. yds. (250 tons) in one bite. These processes of heavy construction have a devastating kind of primordial grandeur, and are in many ways more astonishing than the finished project—be it a road or a building. The actual disruption of the earth’s crust is at times very compelling, and seems to confirm Heraclitus’s Fragment 124, “The most beautiful world is like a heap of rubble tossed down in confusion.” The tools of art have too long been confined to “the studio.” The city gives the illusion that earth does not exist. Heizer calls his earth projects “The alternative to the absolute city system.”"". Use an equal amount of details from both texts.","

Reflecting on how our basic technological systems have interacted with nature, it becomes clear that the earth's elements and energy have been harnessed to meet our material needs, but often at the expense of the environment. The manifestations of technology, from the refined tools of today to the primitive implements of the caveman, are composed of the raw matter of the earth. The process of heavy construction is an awe-inspiring disruption of the earth's crust, and in its chaotic grandeur, it confirms Heraclitus's notion that the most beautiful world is like a heap of rubble tossed down in confusion. The tools of art, which have been confined to the studio, can be used outside of the city to create an alternative to the absolute city system, allowing us to become nature's agents rather than nature's aggressors, and to channel the energy and elements of the earth intelligently for the long-term benefit of the planet."

Exploring the surrounding area with its old trails, crystal caves, disused turquoise, copper, and tungsten mines, old oil wells and windmills, hidden springs, and ancient caves, I had a strong sense of connection to the people who had lived in the caves for so long. From the site, they would have seen the same sun rising and setting over the same mountains and ridges, and I felt the same. Technology and its manifestations, from the most advanced tools and machines to the ""dumb tools"" of the caveman, are made of the raw matter of the earth, and the process of heavy construction has a devastating kind of primordial grandeur.

I experienced this alternative to the absolute city system firsthand, as I watched the dipper of the giant mining power shovel dig 140 cu. yds.

With the help of these tools, art can be taken out of the studio and into the city, creating a chaotic kind of planning that can turn the terrain into an unfinished city of organized wreckage, a sense of Heraclitus' Fragment 124, “The most beautiful world is like a heap of rubble tossed down in confusion.”"

Depending on which of the twelve astronomical charts I consulted, the number and positions of the stars in the constellations varied, increasing my options considerably. Each constellation had also to have enough stars, and to encompass the top half of a tunnel with some holes at eye level on each side, so that the viewer could look through the eye-level holes from the outside and see through the holes on the other side of the tunnel. With those criteria there were only a few constellations that I could use, and from them I chose Draco, Perseus, Columba, and Capricorn. Together, they encompass the globe—Columba is a Southern Hemisphere constellation which slips over the edge of the horizon for a short time each year, but can’t be seen because of the dense atmosphere near the earth. Capricorn is visible in the fall and early winter, and is entered by the sun at the winter solstice. Draco and Perseus are always visible in the sky."" and this text: ""Swirling within the incandescence of solar energy were sprays of blood. My movie would end in sunstroke.

I had the red heaves, while the sun vomited its corpuscular radiations. Rays of glare hit my eyes with the frequency of a Geiger counter. Surely, the storm clouds massing would turn into a rain of blood. Once, when I was flying over the lake, its surface seemed to hold all the properties of an unbroken field of raw meat with gristle (foam); no doubt it was due to some freak wind action. Eyesight is often slaughtered by the other sense, and when that happens it becomes necessary to seek out dispassionate abstractions. The dizzying spiral yearns for the assurance of geometry.

The sky was alive with the promise of possibility, and I sought to capture it in the form of a tunnel. I chose constellations with stars of various magnitudes, so that the holes in the tunnel could be of varying sizes. Draco, Perseus, Columba, and Capricorn were my selections, each visible at different times of the year, and together they encompassed the globe. I could feel the solar energy swirling around me, and I was reminded of the red heaves and the Geiger counter-like frequency of the sun's radiations. I was surrounded by a storm of blood, an unbroken field of raw meat, and a dizzying spiral that yearned for the assurance of geometry. To escape the heat lightning and heat exhaustion, I sought refuge in the cool rooms of reason, and found solace in Van Gogh's abstractions, painted on some sun-baked lagoon. I was determined to capture this moment of incandescence and raw emotion in my movie, and to end it in a sunstroke of beauty."

The Pineys have a solid verbal take on their own land, and their enthusiasm for the film was evident from the start. They've asked for it to be shown at their firehouse and the Green Bank Inn, as the film is a reflection of both the landscape and the people's responses to it, allowing it to reach far beyond the art world. The future air terminal is a unique combination of the physical and the mental, suggesting infinite possibilities within finite boundaries. Straight lines of landing fields and runways create a new perception of perspective, and aerial photography and transportation bring the world's surface features into view. From the airplane window, one can observe drastic changes of scale, from the shrinking terminal to the obstructing clouds, and the landscape begins to take the form of a three-dimensional map rather than a rustic garden. The structures of buildings become optical illusions, and the effect of the view is both dazzling and monotonous."
