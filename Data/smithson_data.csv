The Spiral Jetty,"My concern with salt lakes began with my work in 1968 on the Mono Lake Site-Nonsite in California.1
 Later I read a book called Vanishing Trails of Atacama by William Rudolph which described salt lakes (salars) in Bolivia in all stages of desiccation and filled with micro bacteria that give the water surface a red color. The pink flamingos that live around the salars match the color of the water. In The Useless Land, John Aarons and Claudio Vita-Finzi describe Laguna Colorada: “The basalt (at the shores) is black, the volcanos purple, and their exposed interiors yellow and red. The beach is grey and the lake pink, topped with the icing of iceberg-like masses of salts.”2
 Because of the remoteness of Bolivia and because Mono Lake lacked a reddish color, I decided to investigate the Great Salt Lake in Utah."
The Spiral Jetty,"From New York City I called the Utah Park Development and spoke to Ted Tuttle, who told me that water in the Great Salt Lake north of Lucin Cutoff, which cuts the lake in two, was the color of tomato soup. That was enough of a reason to go out there and have a look. Tuttle told my wife, Nancy Holt, and myself of some people who knew the lake. First we visited Bill Holt who lived in Syracuse. He was instrumental in building a causeway that connected Syracuse with Antelope Island in the southern part of the Great Salt Lake. Although that site was interesting, the water lacked the red coloration I was looking for, so we continued our search. Next we went to see John Silver on Silver Sands Beach near Magna. His sons showed us the only boat that sailed the lake. Due to the high salt content of the water it was impractical for ordinary boats to use the lake, and no large boats at all could go beyond the Lucin Cutoff on which the transcontinental railroad crossed the lake. At that point I was still not sure what shape my work of art would take. I thought of making an island with the help of boats and barges, but in the end I would let the site determine what I would build. We visited Charles Stoddard, who supposedly had the only barge on the north side of the cutoff. Stoddard, a well-driller, was one of the last homesteaders in Utah. His attempt to develop Carrington Island in 1932 ended in failure because he could not find fresh water. “I’ve had the lake,” he said. Yet, while he was living on the island with his family he made many valuable observations of the lake. He was kind enough to take us to Little Valley on the east side of the Lucin Cutoff to look for his barge—it had sunk. The abandoned man-made harbors of Little Valley gave me my first view of the wine-red water, but there were too many “Keep Out” signs around to make that a practical site for anything, and we were told to “stay away” by two angry ranchers. After fixing a gashed gas tank, we returned to Charles Stoddard’s house north of Syracuse on the edge of some salt marshes. He showed us photographs he had taken of “icebergs,”3
 and of Kit Carson’s cross carved on a rock on Fremont Island. We then decided to leave and go to Rozel Point."
The Spiral Jetty,"Driving west on Highway 83 late in the afternoon, we passed through Corinne, then went on to Promontory. Just beyond the Golden Spike Monument, which commemorates the meeting of the rails of the first transcontinental railroad, we went down a dirt road in a wide valley. As we traveled, the valley spread into an uncanny immensity unlike the other landscapes we had seen. The roads on the map became a net of dashes, while in the far distance the Salt Lake existed as an interrupted silver band. Hills took on the appearance of melting solids, and glowed under amber light. We followed roads that glided away into dead ends. Sandy slopes turned into viscous masses of perception. Slowly, we drew near to the lake, which resembled an impassive faint violet sheet held captive in a stoney matrix, upon which the sun poured down its crushing light. An expanse of salt flats bordered the lake, and caught in its sediments were countless bits of wreckage. Old piers were left high and dry. The mere sight of the trapped fragments of junk and waste transported one into a world of modern prehistory. The products of a Devonian industry, the remains of a Silurian technology, all the machines of the Upper Carboniferous Period were lost in those expansive deposits of sand and mud."
The Spiral Jetty,Two dilapidated shacks looked over a tired group of oil rigs. A series of seeps of heavy black oil more like asphalt occur just south of Rozel Point. For forty or more years people have tried to get oil out of this natural tar pool. Pumps coated with black stickiness rusted in the corrosive salt air. A hut mounted on pilings could have been the habitation of “the missing link.” A great pleasure arose from seeing all those incoherent structures. This site gave evidence of a succession of man-made systems mired in abandoned hopes.
The Spiral Jetty,"About one mile north of the oil seeps I selected my site. Irregular beds of limestone dip gently eastward, massive deposits of black basalt are broken over the peninsula, giving the region a shattered appearance. It is one of the few places on the lake where the water comes right up to the mainland. Under shallow pinkish water is a network of mud cracks supporting the jig-saw puzzle that composes the salt flats. As I looked at the site, it reverberated out of the horizons only to suggest an immobile cyclone while flickering light made the entire landscape appear to quake. A dormant earthquake spread into the fluttering stillness, into a spinning sensation without movement. This site was a rotary that enclosed itself in an immense roundness. From that gyrating space emerged the possibility of the Spiral Jetty. No ideas, no concepts, no systems, no structures, no abstractions could hold themselves together in the actuality of that evidence. My dialectics of site and nonsite whirled into an indeterminate state, where solid and liquid lost themselves in each other. It was as if the mainland oscillated with waves and pulsations, and the lake remained rock still. The shore of the lake became the edge of the sun, a boiling curve, an explosion rising into a fiery prominence. Matter collapsing into the lake mirrored in the shape of a spiral. No sense wondering about classifications and categories, there were none."
The Spiral Jetty,"After securing a twenty year lease on the meandering zone,4
 and finding a contractor in Ogden, I began building the jetty in April, 1970. Bob Phillips, the foreman, sent two dump trucks, a tractor, and a large front loader out to the site. The tail of the spiral began as a diagonal line of stakes that extended into the meandering zone. A string was then extended from a central stake in order to get the coils of the spiral. From the end of the diagonal to the center of the spiral, three curves coiled to the left. Basalt and earth were scooped up from the beach at the beginning of the jetty by the front loader, then deposited in the trucks, where upon the trucks backed up to the outline of stakes and dumped the material. On the edge of the water, at the beginning of the tail, the wheels of the trucks sank into a quagmire of sticky gumbo mud. A whole afternoon was spent filling in this spot. Once the trucks passed that problem, there was always the chance that the salt crust resting on the mud flats would break through. The Spiral Jetty was staked out in such a way as to avoid the soft muds that broke up through the salt crust; nevertheless there were some mud fissures that could not be avoided. One could only hope that tension would hold the entire jetty together, and it did. A cameraman was sent by the Ace Gallery in Los Angeles to film the process."
The Spiral Jetty,"The scale of the Spiral Jetty tends to fluctuate depending on where the viewer happens to be. Size determines an object, but scale determines art. A crack in the wall if viewed in terms of scale, not size, could be called the Grand Canyon. A room could be made to take on the immensity of the solar system. Scale depends on one’s capacity to be conscious of the actualities of perception. When one refuses to release scale from size, one is left with an object or language that appears to be certain. For me scale operates by uncertainty. To be in the scale of the Spiral Jetty is to be out of it. On eye level, the tail leads one into an undifferentiated state of matter. One’s downward gaze pitches from side to side, picking out random depositions of salt crystals on the inner and outer edges, while the entire mass echoes the irregular horizons. And each cubic salt crystal echoes the Spiral Jetty in terms of the crystal’s molecular lattice. Growth in a crystal advances around a dislocation point, in the manner of a screw. The Spiral Jetty could be considered one layer within a spiraling crystal lattice, magnified trillions of times."
The Spiral Jetty,"This description echoes and reflects Brancusi’s sketch of James Joyce as a “spiral ear” because it suggests both a visual and an aural scale, in other words it indicates a sense of scale that resonates in the eye and the ear at the same time. Here is a reinforcement and prolongation of spirals that reverberates up and down space and time. So it is that one ceases to consider art in terms of an “object.” The fluctuating resonances reject “objective criticism,” because that would stifle the generative power of both visual and auditory scale. Not to say that one resorts to “subjective concepts,” but rather that one apprehends what is around one’s eyes and ears, no matter how unstable or fugitive. One seizes the spiral, and the spiral becomes a seizure."
The Spiral Jetty,"After a point, measurable steps (“Scale skal n. it. Or L; it. Scala; L scala usually scalae pl., I.a. originally a ladder; a flight of stairs; hence, b. a means of ascent”)5
 descend from logic to the “surd state.” The rationality of a grid on a map sinks into what it is supposed to define. Logical purity suddenly finds itself in a bog, and welcomes the unexpected event. The “curved” reality of sense perception operates in and out of the “straight” abstractions of the mind. The flowing mass of rock and earth of the Spiral Jetty could be trapped by a grid of segments, but the segments would exist only in the mind or on paper. Of course, it is also possible to translate the mental spiral into a three-dimensional succession of measured lengths that would involve areas, volumes, masses, moments, pressures, forces, stresses, and strains; but in the Spiral Jetty the surd takes over and leads one into a world that cannot be expressed by number or rationality. Ambiguities are admitted rather than rejected, contradictions are increased rather than decrease – the alogos undermines the logos. Purity is put in jeopardy. I took my chances on a perilous path, along which my steps zigzagged, resembling a spiral lightning bolt. “We have found a strange footprint on the shores of the unknown. We have devised profound theories, one after another, to account for its origin. At last, we have succeeded in constructing the creature that made the footprint. And lo! It is our own”.6
 For my film (a film is a spiral made up of frames) I would have myself filmed from a helicopter (from the Greek helix, helikos meaning spiral) directly overhead in order to get the scale in terms of erratic steps."
The Spiral Jetty,"Chemically speaking, our blood is analogous in composition to the primordial seas. Following the spiral steps we return to our origins, back to the same pulpy protoplasm, a floating eye adrift in an antediluvian ocean. On the slopes of Rozel Point I closed my eyes, and the sun burned crimson through the lids. I opened them and the Great Salt Lake was bleeding scarlet streaks. My sight was saturated by the color of red algae circulating in the heart of the lake, pumping into ruby currents, no they were veins and arteries sucking up the obscure sediments. My eyes became combustion chambers churning orbs of blood blazing by the light of the sun. All was enveloped in a flaming chromosphere; I thought of Jackson Pollock’s Eyes in the Heat (1946; Peggy Guggenheim Collection). Swirling within the incandescence of solar energy were sprays of blood. My movie would end in sunstroke. Perception was heaving, the stomach turning, I was on a geologic fault that groaned within me. Between heat lightning and heat exhaustion the spiral curled into vaporization. I had the red heaves, while the sun vomited its corpuscular radiations. Rays of glare hit my eyes with the frequency of a Geiger counter. Surely, the storm clouds massing would turn into a rain of blood. Once, when I was flying over the lake, its surface seemed to hold all the properties of an unbroken field of raw meat with gristle (foam); no doubt it was due to some freak wind action. Eyesight is often slaughtered by the other sense, and when that happens it becomes necessary to seek out dispassionate abstractions. The dizzying spiral yearns for the assurance of geometry. One wants to retreat into the cool rooms of reason. But no, there was Van Gogh with his easel on some sun-baked lagoon painting ferns of the Carboniferous Period. Then the mirage faded into the burning atmosphere."
The Spiral Jetty,"The helicopter maneuvered the sun’s reflection through the Spiral Jetty until it reached the center. The water functioned as a vast thermal mirror. From that position the flaming reflection suggested the ion source of a cyclotron that extended into a spiral of collapsed matter. All sense of energy acceleration expired into a rippling stillness of reflected heat. A withering light swallowed the rocky particles of the spiral, as the helicopter gained altitude. All existence seemed tentative and stagnant. The sound of the helicopter motor became a primal groan echoing into tenuous aerial views. Was I but a shadow in a plastic bubble hovering in a place outside mind and body? Et in Utah ego. I was slipping out of myself again, dissolving into a unicellular beginning, trying to locate the nucleus at the end of the spiral. All that blood stirring makes one aware of protoplasmic solutions, the essential matter between the formed and the unformed, masses of cells consisting largely of water, proteins, lipoids, carbohydrates, and inorganic salts. Each drop that splashed onto the Spiral Jetty coagulated into a crystal. Undulating waters spread millions upon millions of crystals over the basalt."
The Spiral Jetty,"Back in New York, the urban desert, I contacted Bob Fiore and Barbara Jarvis and asked them to help me put my movie together. The movie began as a set of disconnections, a bramble of stabilized fragments taken from things obscure and fluid, ingredients trapped in a succession of frames, a stream of viscosities both still and moving. And the movie editor, bending over such a chaos of “takes” resembles a paleontologist sorting out glimpses of a world not yet together, a land that has yet to come to completion, a span of time unfinished, a spaceless limbo on some spiral reels. Film strips hung from the cutter’s rack, bits and pieces of Utah, out-takes overexposed and underexposed, masses of impenetrable material. The sun, the spiral, the salt buried in lengths of footage. Everything about movies and moviemaking is archaic and crude. One is transported by this Archeozoic medium into the earliest known geological eras. The movieola becomes a “time machine” that transforms trucks into dinosaurs. Fiore pulled lengths of film out of the movieola with the grace of a Neanderthal pulling intestines from a slaughtered mammoth. Outside of this 13th Street loft window one expected to see Pleistocene faunas, glacial uplifts, living fossils, and other prehistoric wonders. Like two cavemen we plotted how to get to the Spiral Jetty from New York City. A geopolitics of primordial return ensued. How to get across the geography of Gondwanaland, the Austral Sea, and Atlantis became a problem. Consciousness of the distant past absorbed the time that went into the making of the movie. I needed a map that would show the prehistoric world as coextensive with the world I existed in."
The Spiral Jetty,"I found an oval map of such a double world. The continents of the Jurassic Period merged with continents of today. A microlense fitted to the end of a camera mounted on a heavy tripod would trace the course of “absent images” in the blank spaces of the map. The camera panned from right to left. One is liable to see things in maps that are not there. One must be careful of the hypothetical monsters that lurk between the map’s latitudes; they are designated on the map as black circles (marine reptiles) and squares (land reptiles). In the pan shot one doesn’t see the flesh-eaters walking through what today is called Indochina. There is no indication of Pterodactyls flying over Bombay. And where are the corals and sponges covering southern Germany? In the emptiness one sees no Stegosaurus. In the middle of the pan we see Europe completely under water, but not a trace of the Brontosaurus. What line or color hides the Globigerina Ooze? I don’t know. As the pan ends near Utah, on the edge of Atlantis, a cut takes place, and we found ourselves looking at a rectangular grid known as Location NK 12-7 on the border of a map by the U.S. Geological Survey showing the northern part of the Great Salt Lake without any reference to the Jurassic Period."
The Spiral Jetty,"I wanted Nancy to shoot “the earth’s history” in one minute for the third section of the movie. I wanted to treat the above quote as a “fact.” We drove out to the Great Notch Quarry in New Jersey, where I found a quarry facing about twenty feet high. I climbed to the top and threw handfuls of ripped-up pages from books and magazines over the edge, while Nancy filmed it. Some ripped pages from an Old Atlas blew across a dried out, cracked mud puddle."
The Spiral Jetty,"According to all we know from fossil anatomy that beast was comparatively harmless. Its only weapons were its teeth and claws. I don’t know what those obscene looking paunches mean – they don’t show in any fossil remains yet found. Nor do I know whether red is their natural color, or whether it is due to faster decay owing to all the oil having dropped down off them. So much for its supposed identity.8"
The Spiral Jetty,"The movie recapitulates the scale of the Spiral Jetty. Disparate elements assume a coherence. Unlikely places and things were stuck between sections of film that show a stretch of dirt road rushing to and from the actual site in Utah. A road that goes forward and backward between things and places that are elsewhere. You might even say that the road is nowhere in particular. The disjunction operating between reality and film drives one into a sense of cosmic rupture. Nevertheless, all the improbabilities would accommodate themselves to my cinematic universe. Adrift amid scraps of film, one is unable to suffuse into them any meaning, they seem worn-out, ossified views, degraded and pointless, yet they are powerful enough to hurl one into a lucid vertigo. The road takes one from a telescopic shot of the sun to a quarry in Great Notch New Jersey, to a map showing the “deformed shorelines of ancient Lake Bonneville,” to The Lost World, and to the Hall of Late Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History."
The Spiral Jetty,"The hall was filmed through a red filter. The camera focuses on a Ornithominus Altus embedded in plaster behind a glass case. A pan across the room picked up a crimson chiaroscuro tone. There are times when the great outdoors shrinks phenomenologically to the scale of a prison, and times when the indoors expands to the scale of the universe. So it is with the sequence from the Hall of Late Dinosaurs. An interior immensity spreads throughout the hall, transforming the lightbulbs into dying suns. The red filter dissolves the floor, ceiling, and walls into halations of infinite redness. Boundless desolation emerged from the cinematic emulsions, red clouds, burned from the intangible light beyond the windows, visibility deepened into ruby dispersions. The bones, the glass cases, the armatures brought forth a blood-drenched atmosphere. Blindly the camera stalked through the sullen light. Glassy reflections flashed into dissolutions like powdered blood. Under a burning window the skull of a Tyrannosaurus was mounted in a glass case with a mirror under the skull. In this limitless scale one’s mind imagines things that are not there. The blood-soaked dropping of a sick Duck-Billed Dinosaur, for instance. Rotting monster flesh covered with millions of red spiders. Delusion follows delusion. The ghostly cameraman slides over the glassed-in compounds. These fragments of a timeless geology laugh without mirth at the time-filled hopes of ecology. From the soundtrack the echoing metronome vanishes into the wilderness of bones and glass. Tracking around a glass containing a “dinosaur mummy,” the words of The Unnameable are heard. The camera shifts to a specimen squeezed flat by the weight of sediments, then the film cuts to the road in Utah."
The Spiral Jetty,"The range of convergence between Site and Nonsite consists of a course of hazards, a double path made up of signs, photographs, and maps that belong to both sides of the dialectic at once. Both sides are present and absent at the same time. The land or ground from the Site is placed in the art (Nonsite) rather than the art placed on the ground. The Nonsite is a container within another container – the room. The plot or yard outside is yet another container. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional things trade places with each other in the range of convergence. Large scale becomes small. Small scale becomes large. A point on a map expands to the size of the land mass. A land mass contracts to a point. Is the Site a reflection of the Nonsite (mirror), or is it the other way around? The rules of this network of signs are discovered as you go along uncertain trails both mental and physical."
The Spiral Jetty,"“No fish or reptile lives in it (Mono Lake), yet it swarms with millions of worms which develop into flies. These rest on the surface and cover everything on the immediate shore. The number and quantity of those worms and flies is absolutely incredible. The drift up in heaps along the shore.” W.H. Brewer, The Whitney Survey, 1863."
The Spiral Jetty,"Beginning at a point South 3000 feet and West 800 feet from the Northeast Corner of Section 8, Township 8 North, Range 7 West; thence South 45° West 651 feet; thence North 60° West 651 feet; thence North 45° East 651 feet; thence Southeasterly along the meander line 675 feet to the point of beginning. Containing 10.00 acres, more or less. (Special Use Lease Agreement No. 222; witness: Mr. Mark Crystal.)"
Interpolation of the Enantiomorphic Chambers,"Once, when I was fortunate enough to gain access to the private art-book library of the late Casper Clamp, I had the privilege of scrutinizing his rare edition of “The Exhaustion of Sight or How to Go Blind and Yet See.” Only six volumes remain of this astounding work. The book’s heavy pages contained intricate diagrams “on seeing sight.” A chapter called “Invisible Orbs,” illustrated special visual conditions known as “lead eyes, ice eyes, pyramidal eyes, and violet eyes.” Much was said about eyeglasses as “a structure supported by the nose and ears.” The few artists that have seen this book, such as Daniel Nivalk and Mary Bone have been in some way altered. Nivalk finds the book “suspect,” but nevertheless agrees that it contains many “hitherto unknown facts about visual acedia.” On the other hand Mary Bone, known in certain circles for her “Smoke on Smoke,” finds Clamp’s book, “the key to flying saucers.” For myself, the book is a true paradigm of unending importance. I look forward to the day when it will be published in “paperback,” so that millions of artists everywhere will be able to share in its many treasures."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Many architectural concepts found in science-fiction have nothing to do with science or fiction,instead they suggest a new kind of monumentality which has much in common with the aims of some of today’s artists. I am thinking in particular of Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt, Dan Flavin, and of certain artists in the “Park Place Group.” The artists who build structured canvases and “wall-size” paintings, such as Will Insley, Peter Hutchinson and Frank Stella are more indirectly related. The chrome and plastic fabricators such as Paul Thek, Craig Kauffman, and Larry Bell are also relevant. The works of many of these artists celebrate what Flavin calls “inactive history” or what the physicist calls “entropy” or “energy-drain.” They bring to mind the Ice Age rather than the Golden Age, and would most likely confirm Vladimir Nabokov’s observation that, “The future is but the obsolete in reverse.” In a rather round-about way, many of the artists have provided a visible analog for the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which extrapolates the range of entropy by telling us energy is more easily lost than obtained, and that in the ultimate future the whole universe will burn out and be transformed into an all-encompassing sameness. The “blackout” that covered the Northeastern states recently, may be seen as a preview of such a future. Far from creating a mood of dread, the power failure created a mood of euphoria. An almost cosmic joy swept over all the darkened cities. Why people felt that way may never be answered."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Instead of causing us to remember the past like the old monuments, the new monuments seem to cause us to forget the future. Instead of being made of natural materials, such as marble, granite, or other kinds of rock, the new monuments are made of artificial materials, plastic, chrome, and electric light. They are not built for the ages, but rather against the ages. They are involved in a systematic reduction of time down to fractions of seconds, rather than in representing the long spaces of centuries. Both past and future are placed into an objective present. This kind of time has little or no space; it is stationary and anti-Newtonian, as well as being instant, and is against the wheels of the time-clock. Flavin makes “instant-monuments”; parts for “Monument 7 for V. Tatlin” were purchased at the Radar Fluorescent Company. The “instant” makes Flavin’s work a part of time rather than space. Time becomes a place minus motion. If time is a place, then innumerable places are possible. Flavin turns gallery-space into gallery time. Time breaks down into many times. Rather than saying, “What time is it?”, we should say, “Where is the time?” “Where is Flavin’s Monument?” The objective present at times seems missing. A million years is contained in a second, yet we tend to forget the second as soon as it happens. Flavin’s destruction of classical time and space is based on an entirely new notion of the structure of matter."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Time as decay or biological evolution is eliminated by many of these artists; this displacement allows the eye to see time as an infinity of surfaces or structures, or both combined, without the burden of what Roland Barthes calls the “undifferentiated mass of organic sensation.” The concealed surfaces in some of Judd’s works are hideouts for time. His art vanishes into a series of motionless intervals based on an order of solids. Robert Grosvenor’s suspended structural surfaces cancel out the notion of weight, and reverse the orientation of matter within the solid-state of inorganic time. This reduction of time all but annihilates the value of the notion of “action” in art."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Mistakes and dead-ends often mean more to these artists than any proven problem. Questions about form seems as hopelessly inadequate as questions about content. Problems are unnecessary because problems represent values that create the illusion of purpose. The problem of “form vs. content,” for example, leads to illusionistic dialectics that become, at best, formalist reactions against content. Reaction follows action, till finally the artist gets “tired” and settles for a monumental inaction. The action-reaction syndrome is merely the leftovers of what Marshall McLuhan calls the hypnotic state of mechanism. According to him, an electrical numbing or torpor has replaced the mechanical breakdown. The awareness of the ultimate collapse of both mechanical and electrical technology has motivated these artists to build their monuments to or against entropy. As LeWitt points out, “I am not interested in idealizing technology.” LeWitt might prefer the word “sub-monumental,” especially if we consider his proposal to put a piece of Cellini’s jewelry into a block of cement. An almost alchemic fascination with inert properties is his concern here, but LeWitt prefers to turn gold into cement."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"The much denigrated architecture of Park Avenue known as “cold glass boxes,” along with the Manneristic modernity of Philip Johnson, have helped to foster the entropic mood. The Union Carbide building best typifies such architectural entropy. In its vast lobby one may see an exhibition called “The Future.” It offers the purposeless “educational” displays of Will Burtin, “internationally acclaimed for his three-dimensional designs,” which portray “Atomic Energy in Action.”If ever there was an example of action in entropy, this is it. The action is frozen into an array of plastic and neon, and enhanced by the sound of Muzak faintly playing in the background. At a certain time of day, you may also see a movie called “The Petrified River.” A nine-foot vacuum-formed blue plexiglass globe is a model of a uranium atom—“ten million trillion trillion times the size of the actual atom.” Lights on the ends of flexible steel rods are whipped about in the globe. Parts of the “underground” movie, “The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man,” were filmed in this exhibition hall. Taylor Mead creeps around in the film like a loony sleepwalker, and licks the plastic models depicting “chain-reaction.” The sleek walls and high ceilings give the place an uncanny tomb-like atmosphere. There is something irresistible about such a place, something grand and empty."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"This kind of architecture without “value of qualities,” is, if anything, a fact. From this “undistinguished” run of architecture, as Flavin calls it, we gain a clear perception of physical reality free from the general claims of “purity and idealism.” Only commodities can afford such illusionistic values; for instance, soap is 99 44/100% pure, beer has more spirit in it, and dog food is ideal; all and all this means such values are worthless. As the cloying effect of such “values” wears off, one perceives the “facts” of the outer edge, the flat surface, the banal, the empty, the cool, blank after blank; in other words, that infinitesimal condition known as entropy."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"The slurbs, urban sprawl, and the infinite number of housing developments of the post-war boom have contributed to the architecture of entropy. Judd, in a review of a show by Roy Lichtenstein, speaks of “a lot of visible things” that are “bland and empty,” such as “most
modern commercial buildings, new Colonial stores, lobbies, most houses, most clothing, sheet aluminum, and plastic with leather texture, the formica like wood, the cute and modern patterns inside jets and drugstores.” Near the super highways surrounding the city, we find the discount centers and cut-rate stores with their sterile facades. On the inside of such places are maze-like counters with piles of neatly stacked merchandise; rank on rank it goes into a consumer oblivion. The lugubrious complexity of these interiors has brought to art a new consciousness of the vapid and the dull. But this very vapidity and dullness is what inspires many of the more gifted artists. Morris has distilled many such dull facts and made them into monumental artifices of “idea.” In such a way, Morris has restored the idea of immortality by accepting it as a vast immobility; he has even gone so far as to fashion a bra out of lead. (This he has made for his dance partner, Yvonne Rainer, to help stop the motion in her dances.)"
Entropy and the New Monuments,"This kind of nullification has re-created Kasimir Malevich’s “non-objective world,” where there are no more “likenesses of reality, no idealistic images, nothing but a desert!” But for many of today’s artists this “desert” is a “City of the Future” made of null structures and surfaces. This “City” performs no natural function, it simply exists between mind and matter, detached from both, representing neither. It is, in fact, devoid of all classical ideals of space and process. It is brought into focus by a strict condition of perception, rather than by any expressive or emotive means. Perception as a deprivation of action and reaction brings to the minds the desolate, but exquisite, surface-structures of the empty “box” or “lattice.” As action decreases, the clarity of such surface-structures increases. This is evident in art when all representations of action pass into oblivion. At this stage, lethargy is elevated to the most glorious magnitude. In Damon Knight’s Sci-fic novel, “Beyond the Barrier,” he describes in a phenomenological manner just such surface-structures: “Part of the scene before them seemed to expand. Where one of the flotation machines had been, there was a dim lattice of crystals, growing more shadowy and insubstantial as it swelled; then darkness; then a dazzle of faint prismatic light-tiny complexes in a vast three-dimensional array, growing steadily bigger.” This description has none of the “values” of the naturalistic “literary” novel, it is crystalline, and of the mind by virtue of being outside of unconscious action. This very well could be an inchoate concept for a work by Judd, LeWitt, Flavin, or Insley."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"It seems that beyond the barrier, there are only more barriers. Insley’s “Night Wall” is both a grid and a blockade; it offers no escape. Flavin’s fluorescent lights all but prevent prolonged viewing; ultimately, there is nothing to see. Judd turns the logic of set theory into block-like facades. These facades hide nothing but the wall they hang on."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"LeWitt’s first one-man show at the now defunct Daniel’s Gallery presented a rather uncompromising group of monumental “obstructions.” Many people were “left cold” by them, or found their finish “too dreary.” These obstructions stood as visible clues of the future. A future of humdrum practicality in the shape of standardized office buildings modeled after Emery Roth; in other words, a jerry-built future, a feigned future, an ersatz future very much like the one depicted in the movie “The Tenth Victim.” LeWitt’s show has helped to neutralize the myth of progress. It has also corroborated Wylie Sypher’s insight that “Entropy is evolution in reverse.” LeWitt’s work carries with it the brainwashed mood of Jasper Johns’ “Tennyson,” Flavin’s “Coran’s Broadway Flesh” and Stella’s “The Marriage of Reason and Squalor.”"
Entropy and the New Monuments,Morris also discloses this backward looking future with “erections” and “vaginas” embedded in lead. They tend to illustrate fossilized sexuality by mixing the time states or ideas of “1984” with “One Million B.C.” Claes Oldenburg achieves a similar conjunction of time with his prehistoric “ray-guns.” This sense of extreme past and future has its partial origin with the Museum of Natural History; there the “cave-man” and the “space-man” may be seen under one roof. In this museum all “nature” is stuffed and interchangeable.
Entropy and the New Monuments,"'Lust for Life' is the story of the great sensualist painter Vincent Van Gogh, who bounds through the pages and passions of Irving Stone’s perennial bestseller. And this is the Van Gogh overwhelmingly brought before us by Kirk Douglas in M-G-M’s film version, shot in Cinemascope and a sunburst of color on the actual sites of Van Gogh’s struggles to feel feelings never felt before."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Unlike the hyper-prosaism of Morris, Flavin, LeWitt, and Judd, the works of Thek, Kauffman, and Bell convey a hyper-opulence. Thek’s sadistic geometry is made out of simulated hunks of torn flesh. Bloody meat in the shape of a birthday cake is contained under a pyramidal chrome framework—it has stainless steel candles in it. Tubes for drinking “blood cocktails” are inserted into some of his painful objects. Thek achieves a putrid finesse, not unlike that disclosed in William S. Burroughs’ “Nova Express”; “—Flesh juice in festering spines of terminal sewage— Run down of Spain and 42nd St. to the fish city of marble flesh grafts—.” The vacuum-formed plastic reliefs by Kauffman have a pale lustrous surface presence. A lumpy sexuality is implicit in the transparent forms he employs. Something of the primal nightmare exists in both Thek and Kauffman. The slippery bubbling ooze from the movie “The Blob” creeps into one’s mind. Both Thek and Kauffman have arrested the movement of blob-type matter. The mirrored reflections in Bell’s work are contaminations of a more elusive order. His chrome-plated lattices contain a Pythagorean chaos. Reflections reflect reflections in an excessive but pristine manner."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Some artists see an infinite number of movies. Hutchinson, for instance, instead of going to the country to study nature, will go to see a movie on 42nd Street, like “Horror at Party Beach” two or three times and contemplate it for weeks on end. The movies give a ritual pattern to the lives of many artists, and this induces a kind of “low-budget” mysticism, which keeps them in a perpetual trance. The “blood and guts” of horror movies provides for their “organic needs,” while the “cold steel” of Sci-fic movies provides for their “inorganic needs.” Serious movies are too heavy on “values,” and so are dismissed by the more perceptive artists. Such artists have X-ray eyes, and can see through all of that cloddish substance that passes for “the deep and profound” these days. Some landmarks of Sci-fic are: Creation of the Humanoids (Andy Warhol’s favorite movie), The Planet of the Vampires (movie about entropy), The Thing, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Time Machine, Village of the Giants, (first teen-science film), War of the Worlds (interesting metallic machines). Some landmarks of Horror are: Creature from the Black Lagoon, I Was a Teenage Werewolf, Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus (very sickening), Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Artists that like Horror tend toward the emotive, while artists who like Sci-fic tend toward the perceptive."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Even more of a mental conditioner than the movies, is the actual movie house. Especially the “moderne” interior architecture of the new “art-houses” like Cinema I and II, 57th St. Lincoln Art Theatre, the Coronet, Cinema Rendezvous, the Cinema Village, the Baronet, the Festival, and the Murray Hill. Instead of the crummy baroque and rococo of the 42nd Street theaters, we get the “padded cell” look, the “stripped down” look, or the “good-taste” look. The physical confinement of the dark box-like room indirectly conditions the mind. Even the place where you buy your ticket is called a “box-office.” The lobbies are usually full of box-type fixtures like the soda-machine, the candy counter, and telephone booths. Time is compressed or stopped inside the movie house, and this in turn provides the viewer with an entropic condition. To spend time in a movie house is to make a “hole” in one’s life."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Recently, there has been an attempt to formulate an analog between “communication theory” and the ideas of physics in terms of entropy. As A. J. Ayer has pointed out, not only do we communicate what s true, but also what is false. Often the false has a greater “reality” than the true. Therefore, it seems that all information, and that includes anything that is visible, has its entropic side. Falseness, as an ultimate, is inextricably a part of entropy, and this falseness is devoid of moral implications."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Like the movies and the movie houses, “printed-matter” plays an entropic role. Maps, charts, advertisements, art books, science books, money, architectural plans, math books, graphs, diagrams, newspapers, comics, booklets and pamphlets from industrial companies are all treated the same. Judd has a labyrinthine collection of “printed-matter,” some of which he “looks” at rather than reads. By this means he might take a math equation, and by sight, translate it into a metal progression of structured intervals. In this context, it is best to think of “printed-matter” the way Borges thinks of it, as “The universe (which others call the library),” or like McLuhan’s “Gutenberg Galaxy,” in other words as an unending “library of Babel.” This condition is reflected in Henry Geldzahler’s remark, “I’m doing a book on European painting since 1900—a drugstore book. Dell is printing 100,000 copies.” Too bad Dell isn’t printing 100,000,000,000."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Judd’s sensibility encompasses geology, and mineralogy. He has an excellent collection of geologic maps, which he scans from time to time, not for their intended content, but for their exquisite structural precision. His own writing style has much in common with the terse, factual descriptions one finds in his collection of geology books. Compare this passage from one of his books, “The Geology of Jackson County, Missouri” to his own criticism: “The interval between the Cement City and the Raytown limestones varies from 10 to 23 feet. The lower three-quarters is an irregularly colored green, blue, red, and yellow shale which at some places contains calcareous concretions.” And now an excerpt from Judd’s review of Dan Flavin’s first one-man show: “The light is bluntly and awkwardly stuck on the square block; it protrudes awkwardly. The red in the green attached to a lighter green is off as color, and as sequence.”"
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Many of Morris’s wall structures are direct homages to Duchamp; they deploy facsimiles of ready-mades within high Manneristic frames of reference. Extensions of the Cartesian mind are carried to the most attenuated points of no return by a systematic annulment of movement. Descartes’ cosmology is brought to a standstill. Movement in Morris’s work is engulfed by many types of stillness: delayed action, inadequate energy, general slowness, an all over sluggishness. The ready-mades are, in fact, puns on the Bergsonian concept of “creative evolution” with its idea of “ready made categories.” Says Bergson, “The history of philosophy is there, however, and shows us the eternal conflict of systems, the impossibility of satisfactorily getting the real into the ready-made garments of our ready-made concepts, the necessity of making to measure.” But it is just such an “impossibility” that appeals to Duchamp and Morris. With this in mind, Morris’s monstrous “ideal” structures are inconsequential or uncertain ready-mades, which are definitively outside of Bergson’s concept of creative evolution. If anything, they are uncreative in the manner of the 16th-century alchemist-philosopher-artist. C. G. Jung’s writing on “The Materia Prima” offers many clues in this direction. Alchemy, it seems, is a concrete way of dealing with sameness. In this context, Duchamp and Morris may be seen as artificers of the uncreative or decreators of the Real. They are like the 16th-century artist Parmigianino, who “gave up painting to become an alchemist.” This might help us to understand both Judd’s and Morris’s interest in geology. It is also well to remember that Parmigiano and Duchamp both painted “Virgins” when they did paint. Sydney Freedberg observed in the work of Parmigianino “. . . an assembly of surfaces, nothing is contained within these surfaces . . .” Such an observation might also be applied to Duchamp’s hollow “Virgins,” with their insidious almost lewd associations. The “purist” surfaces of certain artists have a “contamination” in them that relates to Duchamp and Parmigianino, if not in fact, at least in idea."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"The impure-purist surface is very much in evidence in the new abstract art, but I think Stella was the first to employ it. The iridescent purple, green, and silver surfaces that followed Stella’s all-black works, conveyed a rather lurid presence through their symmetries. An exacerbated, gorgeous color gives a chilling bite to the purist context. Immaculate beginnings are subsumed by glittering ends. Like Mallarme’s “Herodiade,” these surfaces disclose a “cold scintillation”; they seem to “love the horror of being virgin.” These inaccessible surfaces deny any definite meaning in the most definite way. Here beauty is allied with the repulsive in accordance with highly rigid rules. One’s sight is mentally abolished by Stella’s hermetic kingdom of surfaces."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Stella’s immaculate but sparkling symmetries are reflected in John Chamberlain’s “KandyKolored” reliefs. “They are extreme, snazzy, elegant in the wrong way, immoderate.” Says Judd, “It is also interesting that the surfaces of the reliefs are definitely surfaces.” Chamberlain’s use of chrome and metalflake brings to mind the surfaces in “Scorpio Rising,” Kenneth Anger’s many-faceted horoscopic film about constellated motorcyclists. Both Chamberlain and Anger have developed what could be called California surfaces. In a review of the film, Ken Kelman speaks of “. . . the ultimate reduction of ultimate experience to brilliant chromatic surface; Thanatos in Chrome—artificial death . . .” in a way that evokes Chamberlain’s giddy reliefs."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Judd bought a purple Florite crystal at the World’s Fair. He likes the “uncreated” look of it and its impenetrable color. John Chamberlain, upon learning of Judd’s interest in such a color, suggested he go to the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Company and get some “Hi-Fi” lacquer. Judd did this and “self” sprayed some of his works with it. This transparent lacquer allows the “star-spangled” marking on iron sheet to come through, making the surfaces look mineral hard. His standard crystallographic boxes come in a variety of surfaces from Saturnian orchid-plus to wrinkle-textured blues and greens—alchemy from the year 2000."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"The formal logic of crystallography, apart from any preconceived scientific content, relates to Judd’s art in an abstract way. If we define an abstract crystal as a solid bounded by symmetrically grouped surfaces, which have definite relationships to a set of imaginary lines called axes, then we have a clue to the structure of Judd’s “pink plexiglass box.” Inside the box five wires are strung in a way that resembles very strongly the crystallographic idea of axes. Yet, Judd’s axes don’t correspond with any natural crystal. The entire box would collapse without the tension of the axes. The five axes polarize between two stainless steel sides. The inside surfaces of the steel sides are visible through the transparent plexiglass. Every surface is within full view, which makes the inside and outside equally important. Like many of Judd’s works, the separate parts of the box are held together by tension and balance, both of which add to its static existence."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"The Park Place Group (Mark di Suvero, Dean Fleming, Peter Forakis, Robert Grosvenor, Anthony Magar, Tamara Melcher, Forrest Myers, Ed Ruda, and Leo Valledor) exists in a space-time monastic order, where they research a cosmos modeled after Einstein. They have also permuted the “models” of R. Buckminster Fuller’s “vectoral” geometry in the most astounding manner."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Fuller was told by certain scientists that the fourth dimension was ‘ha-ha,” in other words, that it is laughter. Perhaps it is. It is well to remember, that the seemingly topsy-turvy world revealed by Lewis Carroll, did spring from a well ordered mathematical mind. Martin Gardner in his “The Annotated Alice,” notes that in a science-fiction story “Mimsy Were the Borogroves,” the author, Lewis Padgett, presents the Jabberwocky as a secret language from the future, and that if rightly understood, it would explain a way of entering the fourth dimension. The highly ordered non-sense of Carroll, suggests that there might be a similar way to treat laughter. Laughter is in a sense a kind of entropic “verbalization.” How could artists translate this verbal entropy, that is “ha-ha,” into “solid-models”? Some of the Park Place artists seem to be researching this “curious” condition. The order and disorder of the fourth dimension could be set between laughter and crystal-structure, as a device for unlimited speculation."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Let us now define the different types of Generalized Laughter, according to the six main crystal systems: the ordinary laugh is cubic or square (Isometric), the chuckle is a triangle or pyramid (Tetragonal), the giggle is a hexagon or rhomboid (Hexagonal), the titter is prismatic (Orthorhombic), the snicker is oblique (Monoclinic), the guffaw is asymmetric (Triclinic). To be sure this definition only scratches the surface, but I think it will do for the present. If we apply this “ha-ha-crystal” concept to the monumental models being produced by some of the artists in the Park Place group, we might begin to understand the fourth-dimensional nature of their work. From here on in, we must not think of Laughter as a laughing matter, but rather as the “matter-of-laughs.”"
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Solid-state hilarity, as manifest through the “ha-ha-crystal” concept, appears in a patently anthropomorphic way in “Alice in Wonderland,” as the Cheshire Cat. Says Alice to the Cat, “. . . you make one quite giddy!” This anthropomorphic element has much in common with impure-purist art. The “grin without a cat” indicates “laugh-matter and/or anti-matter,” not to mention something approaching a solid giddiness. Giddiness of this sort is reflected in Myers’ plastic contraptions. Myers sets hard titter against soft snickers, and puts hard guffaws onto soft giggles. A fit of silliness becomes a rhomboid, a high-pitched discharge of mirth becomes prismatic, a happy outburst becomes a cube, and so forth."
Entropy and the New Monuments,"Through direct observation, rather than explanation, many of these artists have developed ways to treat the theory of sets, vectoral geometry, topology and crystal structure. The diagrammatic methods of the “new math” have led to a curious phenomenon. Namely, a more visible math that is unconcerned with size or shape in any metrical sense. The “paper and pencil operations” that deal with the invisible structure of nature have found new models, and have been combined with some of the more fragile states of mind. Math is dislocated by the artists in a personal way, so that it becomes “Manneristic” or separated from its original meaning. This dislocation of meaning provides the artist with what could be called “synthetic math.” Charles Pierce (1839-1914), the American philosopher, speaks of “graphs” that would “put before us moving pictures of thought.” (See Martin Gardner’s “Logic Machines and Diagrams.”) This synthetic math is reflected in Duchamp’s “measured” pieces of fallen threads, “Three Standard Stoppages,” Judd’s sequential structured surfaces, Valledor’s “fourth dimensional” color vectors, Grosvenor’s hypervolumes in hyperspace, and di Suvero’s demolitions of space-time. These artists face the possibility of other dimensions, with a new kind of sight."

"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","On Saturday, September 30, 1967, I went to the
Port Authority Building on 41st Street and 8th
Avenue. I bought a copy of the New York Times
and a Signet paperback called Earthworks by
Brian W. Aldiss. Next I went to ticket booth 21
and purchased a one-way ticket to Passaic. After
that I went up to the upper bus level (platform
173) and boarded the number 30 bus of the
Inter-City Transportation Co."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","I sat down and opened the Times. I glanced
over the art section: a “Collectors’, Critics’,
Curators’ Choice” at A.M. Sachs Gallery (a letter I
got in the mail that morning invited me “to play
the game before the show closes October 4th”),
Walter Schatzki was selling “Prints, Drawings,
Watercolors” at “33⅓% off,” Elinor Jenkins, the “Romantic Realist,” was showing at Barzansky
Galleries, XVIII—XIX Century English Furniture
on sale at Parke-Bernet, “New Directions in German Graphics” at Goethe House, and on page 29
was John Canaday’s column. He was writing onThemes and the Usual Variations. I looked at a
blurry reproduction of Samuel F. B. Morse’sAllegorical Landscape at the top of Canaday’s
column; the sky was a subtle newsprint grey,
and the clouds resembled sensitive stains of
sweat reminiscent of a famous Yugoslav watercolorist whose name I have forgotten. A little
statue with right arm held high faced a pond (or
was it the sea?). “Gothic” buildings in the allegory had a faded look, while an unnecessary tree
(or was it a cloud of smoke?) seemed to puff up
on the left side of the landscape. Canaday referred to the picture as “standing confidently
along with other allegorical representatives of
the arts, sciences, and high ideals that universities foster.” My eyes stumbled over the newsprint, over such headlines as “Seasonal Upswing,” “A Shuffle Service,” and “Moving a
1,000 Pound Sculpture Can Be a Fine Work of Art,
Too.” Other gems of Canaday’s dazzled my mind
as I passed through Secaucus. “Realistic waxworks of raw meat beset by vermin,” (Paul Thek),
“Mr. Bush and his colleagues are wasting their
time,” (Jack Bush), “a book, an apple on a
saucer, a rumpled cloth,” (Thyra Davidson). Outside the bus window a Howard Johnson’s Motor
Lodge flew by—a symphony in orange and blue.
On page 31 in Big Letters: THE EMERGING
POLICE STATE IN AMERICA SPY GOVERNMENT.
“In this book you will learn . . . what an Infinity
Transmitter is.”"
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","I read the blurbs and skimmed throughEarthworks. The first sentence read, “The dead
man drifted along in the breeze.” It seemed the
book was about a soil shortage, and theEarthworks referred to the manufacture of artificial soil. The sky over Rutherford was a clear
cobalt blue, a perfect Indian summer day, but the
sky in Earthworks was a “great black and brown
shield on which moisture gleamed.”"
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","The bus passed over the first monument. I
pulled the buzzer-cord and got off at the corner of
Union Avenue and River Drive. The monument
was a bridge over the Passaic River that connected Bergen County with Passaic County.
Noon-day sunshine cinema-ized the site, turning
the bridge and the river into an over-exposedpicture. Photographing it with my Instamatic 400 was like photographing a photograph. The sun
became a monstrous light-bulb that projected a
detached series of “stills” through my Instamatic
into my eye. When I walked on the bridge, it was
as though I was walking on an enormous photograph that was made of wood and steel, and
underneath the river existed as an enormous
movie film that showed nothing but a continuous
blank."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","The steel road that passed over the water was
in part an open grating flanked by wooden sidewalks, held up by a heavy set of beams, while
above, a ramshackle network hung in the air. A
rusty sign glared in the sharp atmosphere, making it hard to read. A date flashed in the sunshine . . . 1899 . . . No . . . 1896 . . . maybe (at the
bottom of the rust and glare was the name Dean
& Westbrook Contractors, N.Y.). I was completely controlled by the Instamatic (or what the
rationalists call a camera). The glassy air of New
Jersey defined the structural parts of the monument as I took snapshot after snapshot. A barge
seemed fixed to the surface of the water as it
came toward the bridge, and caused the bridgekeeper to close the gates. From the banks of
Passaic I watched the bridge rotate on a central axis in order to allow an inert rectangular shape
to pass with its unknown cargo. The Passaic
(West) end of the bridge rotated south, while the
Rutherford (East) end of the bridge rotated north;
such rotations suggested the limited movements
of an outmoded world. “North” and “South”
hung over the static river in a bi-polar manner.
One could refer to this bridge as the “Monument
of Dislocated Directions.”"
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","Along the Passaic River banks were many
minor monuments such as concrete abutments
that supported the shoulders of a new highway
in the process of being built. River Drive was in
part bulldozed and part intact. It was hard to
tell the new highway from the old road; they
were both confounded into a unitary chaos.
Since it was Saturday, many machines were not
working, and this caused them to resemble prehistoric creatures trapped in the mud, or, better,
extinct machines—mechanical dinosaurs
stripped of their skin. On the edge of this prehistoric Machine Age were pre- and post-World
War II suburban houses. The houses mirrored
themselves into colorlessness. A group of children were throwing rocks at each other near a
ditch. “From now on you’re not going to come to our hide-out. And I mean it!” said a little blonde
girl who had been hit with a rock."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","As I walked north along what was left of River
Drive, I saw a monument in the middle of the
river—it was a pumping derrick with a long pipe
attached to it. The pipe was supported in part by
a set of pontoons, while the rest of it extended
about three blocks along the river bank till it
disappeared into the earth. One could hear debris rattling in the water that passed through the
great pipe."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","Nearby, on the river bank, was an artificial
crater that contained a pale limpid pond of water,
and from the side of the crater protruded six
large pipes that gushed the water of the pond
into the river. This constituted a monumental
fountain that suggested six horizontal smokestacks that seemed to be flooding the river with
liquid smoke. The great pipe was in some enigmatic way connected with the infernal fountain.
It was as though the pipe was secretly sodomizing some hidden technological orifice, and causing a monstrous sexual organ (the foundation) to
have an orgasm. A psychoanalyst might say that
the landscape displayed “homosexual tendencies,” but I will not draw such a crass anthropomorphic conclusion. I will merely say, “It
was there.”"
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","Across the river in Rutherford one could hear
the faint voice of a P. A. system and the weak
cheers of a crowd at a football game. Actually,
the landscape was no landscape, but “a particular kind of heliotypy” (Nabokov), a kind of self-destroying postcard world of failed immortality
and oppressive grandeur. I had been wandering
in a moving picture that I couldn’t quite picture,
but just as I became perplexed, I saw a green sign that explained everything:"
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","That zero panorama seemed to contain ruins in
reverse, that is—all the new construction that
would eventually be built. This is the opposite of
the “romantic ruin” because the buildings don’t
fall into ruin after they are built but rather rise
into ruin before they build. This anti-romantic mise-en-scene suggested the discredited idea of
time and many other “out of date” things. But
the suburbs exist without a rational past and
without the “big events” of history. Oh, maybe
there are a few statues, a legend, and a couple of
curios, but no past—just what passes for a future. A Utopia minus a bottom, a place where the
machines are idle, and the sun has turned to
glass, and a place where the Passaic Concrete
Plant (253 River Drive) does a good business in
STONE, BITUMINOUS, SAND, and CEMENT."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","Passaic seems full of “holes” compared to New
York City, which seems tightly packed and solid,
and those holes in a sense are the monumental
vacancies that define, without trying, the
memory-traces of an abandoned set of futures.
Such futures are found in grade B Utopian films,
and then imitated by the suburbanite. The windows of City Motors auto sales proclaim the
existence of Utopia through 1968 WIDE TRACK
PONTIACS—Executive, Bonneville, Tempest,
Grand Prix, Firebirds, GTO, Catalina, and
LeMans—that visual incantation marked the end
of the highway construction."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","Was I in a new territory? (An English artist,
Michael Baldwin, says, “It could be asked if the
country does in fact change—it does not in the
sense a traffic light does.”) Perhaps I had slipped
into a lower stage of futurity—did I leave the real
future behind in order to advance into a false
future? Yes, I did. Reality was behind me at that
point in my suburban Odyssey."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","Passaic center loomed like a dull adjective.
Each “store” in it was an adjective unto the next,
a chain of adjectives disguised as stores. I began to run out of film, and I was getting hungry.
Actually, Passaic center was no center—it was
instead a typical abyss or an ordinary void. What
a great place for a gallery! Or maybe an “outdoor
sculpture show” would pep that place up."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","After that I returned to Passaic, or was it thehereafter—for all I know that unimaginative suburb could have been a clumsy eternity, a cheap
copy of The City of the Immortals. But who am I
to entertain such a thought? I walked down a
parking lot that covered the old railroad tracks
which at one time ran through the middle of
Passaic. That monumental parking lot divided
the city in half, turning it into a mirror and a
reflection—but the mirror kept changing places
with the reflection. One never knew what side of
the mirror one was on. There was nothing interesting or even strange about that flat monument, yet it echoed a kind of cliche idea of
infinity; perhaps the “secrets of the universe”
are just as pedestrian—not to say dreary. Everything about the site remained wrapped in blandness and littered with shiny cars—one after
another they extended into a sunny nebulosity.
The indifferent backs of the cars flashed and
reflected the stale afternoon sun. I took a few listless, entropic snapshots of that lustrous
monument. If the future is “out of date” and “old
fashioned,” then I had been in the future. I had
been on a planet that had a map of Passaic
drawn over it, and a rather imperfect map at that.
A sidereal map marked up with “lines” the size of
streets, and “squares” and “blocks” the size of
buildings. At any moment my feet were apt to fall
through the cardboard ground. I am convinced
that the future is lost somewhere in the dumps of
the non-historical past; it is in yesterday’s newspapers, in the jejune advertisements of science-
fiction movies, in the false mirror of our rejected
dreams. Time turns metaphors into things, and
stacks them up in cold rooms, or places them in
the celestial playgrounds of the suburbs."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","Has Passaic replaced Rome as The Eternal
City? If certain cities of the world were placed
end to end in a straight line according to size,
starting with Rome, where would Passaic be in
that impossible progression? Each city would be
a three-dimensional mirror that would reflect the
next city into existence. The limits of eternity
seem to contain such nefarious ideas."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","The last monument was a sand box or a model
desert. Under the dead light of the Passaic afternoon the desert became a map of infinite disintegration and forgetfulness. This monument of
minute particles blazed under a bleakly glowing
sun, and suggested the sullen dissolution of
entire continents, the drying up of oceans—no
longer were there green forests and high
mountains—all that existed were millions of
grains of sand, a vast deposit of bones and
stones pulverized into dust. Every grain of sand
was a dead metaphor that equaled timelessness,
through the false mirror of eternity. This sand
box somehow doubled as an open grave—a
grave that children cheerfully play in."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","I should now like to prove the irreversibility of
eternity by using a jejune experiment for proving
entropy. Picture in your mind’s eye the sand box
divided in half with black sand on one side and
white sand on the other. We take a child and have him run hundreds of times clockwise in the
box until the sand gets mixed and begins to turn
grey; after that we have him run anti-clockwise,
but the result will not be a restoration of the
original division but a greater degree of greyness
and an increase of entropy."
"A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey","Of course, if we filmed such an experiment we
could prove the reversibility of eternity by showing the film backwards, but then sooner or later
the film itself would crumble or get lost and enter
the state of irreversibility. Somehow this suggests that the cinema offers an illusive or
temporary escape from physical dissolution. The
false immortality of the film gives the viewer an
illusion of control over eternity—but “the
superstars” are fading."
A Provisional Theory of Nonsites,"By drawing a diagram, a ground plan of a house, a street plan to the location of
a site, or a topographic map, one draws a “logical two dimensional picture.” A
“logical picture” differs from a natural or realistic picture in that it rarely looks
like the thing it stands for. It is a two dimensional analogy or metaphor—A is Z."
A Provisional Theory of Nonsites,"The Nonsite (an indoor earthwork) is a three dimensional logical picture
that is abstract, yet it represents an actual site in N.J. (The Pine Barrens Plains). It
is by this three dimensional metaphor that one site can represent another site
which does not resemble it—thus The Nonsite. To understand this language
of sites is to appreciate the metaphor between the syntactical construct and the
complex of ideas, letting the former function as a three dimensional picture
which doesn't look like a picture. “Expressive art” avoids the problem of logic;
therefore it is not truly abstract. A logical intuition can develop in an entirely
“new sense of metaphor” free of natural or realistic expressive content. Between the actual site in the Pine Barrens and The Nonsite itself exists a space of
metaphoric significance. It could be that “travel” in this space is a vast metaphor. Everything between the two sites could become physical metaphorical
material devoid of natural meanings and realistic assumptions. Let us say that
one goes on a fictitious trip if one decides to go to the site of the Nonsite. The
“trip” becomes invented, devised, artificial; therefore, one might call it a non-
trip to a site from a Nonsite. Once one arrives at the “airfield,” one discovers
that it is man-made in the shape of a hexagon, and that I mapped this site in
terms of esthetic boundaries rather than political or economic boundaries (31
sub-divisions—see map)."
