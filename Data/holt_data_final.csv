Hydra's Head,"The Seneca Indians of New York have a saying: “Pools of water are the eyes of the earth.” At night the pools of Hydra’s Head “see” the stars brought down into their circumferences, by day they catch in their “view” sky, clouds, sun, and a bird or two. The moon is seen moving from pool to pool as I walk—a continuous recurrence of light encircled. Eddies and whirlpools in the river below, fed by the mad waters of Niagara Falls seven miles upstream, keep up a loud rhythm— there’s always the sound of water. Hearing and seeing come together in a vaporous fusion. The sky has suddenly fallen and is circled at my feet. Clouds drift through the earth, the sun gleams off the windblown ripples. A bottomless hole is there to engulf me. A sinking feeling begins to pervade. Nature’s mirrors absorb. The color of the concrete pipe seen rimming the pools echoes in the color of the rocks nearby. The concrete separating water from earth is itself made of these elements—sand, stones, water combined. From time to time the air moves and waves the water. Then reflections waver, breaking up on the surface, becoming whole again in stillness. Changes in sunlight cause the color of entire pools to change or vanish in a silvery glimmer. Shades of green, aquamarine, blue, and silver come and go as I move around the pools. The depth and diameter of the sunken pipes causes shadows to be continuously cast; the green-gray color of wet concrete and the slight haze of river water all come together to bring about the surface color and the endlessness of the pools. The bottoms are invisible, the depths unknown. Evaporation and rain interact in an emptying and replenishing cycle. Each drop of rain causes circular ripples to multiply—circles within circles within circles. Water cascades down a tiny waterfall nearby. Falling water, rushing water, swirling water, still water, sound of water, color of water coalesce here in this place of water, not far from Niagara Falls—their proximity always felt, producing a continuous flow of liquid meditations."
Catch Basin,"Catch Basin, an artwork that is also a land drainage system in St. James Park, Toronto, Canada, evolved out of my recent concern with exposing and utilizing functional systems, which are usually hidden beneath the surfaces of our existence. These structural, functional networks—electricity, drainage, heating, plumbing—are basic technologies which support our everyday lives, but are usually only considered when breakdowns occur."
Catch Basin,"About ten feet above the sunken grate two steel rings are suspended from fifteen-foot posts by chains. The rings are the same diameter as the basin rim and the grate, echoing their structure and depth above. Circles of sky are framed through the rings, the entire structure of the work bringing the sky, as well as the water, down to earth."
Catch Basin,"Catch Basin is built to be functional—its function is visible only when it rains, at a time not generally considered ideal for viewing art. The rain washes down the grassy slopes into the channel pipe, following the natural topography of the land and flowing always toward the lowest point—the center—disappearing finally through the hole in the drain to be absorbed by the gravel and earth below. In the case of a torrential rain, there is an overflow pipe to channel floodwater into the city's underground drainage system."
Catch Basin,"It is not necessary to actually see the sculpture work when rain is falling; what is essential is that the sculpture has a functional aspect. Without the presence of rainwater one can still imagine the missing element, giving the work a potential—a sense of what might be. The structure of Catch Basin tracks its own function."
Catch Basin,"Catch Basin can evoke ancient drainage systems, some of the oldest of which have been in use since 5,000 B.C. in Crete. Egypt and Babylon drained wetlands, and Cato in 200 B.C. discussed farm irrigation in Roman land. Drainage technology in North America reached its apex in the late nineteenth century and has remained relatively unchanged since. John Johnston is credited with using tile drainage first in the United States, importing horseshoe-shaped tile from Scotland to his Geneva, New York, farm in 1835. His neighbors scoffed, but in 1848 after his system was successful, an English machine for making tile was brought to America. Since then, on this continent, tile drainage has been responsible for the blooming of deserts and the increase of crops in many places."
Ventilation Series,"Since the sculptures are exposed fragments of vast, hidden networks, they are part of open-ended systems, part of the world. Over the years these technological systems have become necessary for our everyday existence, yet they are usually hidden behind walls or beneath the earth and relegated to the realm of the unconscious. We have trouble owning up to our almost total dependence on them."
Ventilation Series,"Reflecting on how our basic technological systems have interacted with nature reveals that in the name of technological improvement the environment has frequently been blindly and carelessly damaged. While continuing to meet our immediate material needs, the channeling of the energy and elements of the earth can be done intelligently with the long-term benefit of the planet in mind. In doing so we become nature’s agents rather than nature’s aggressors."
Ventilation Series,"Technic in Greek means “art” or “artifice.” The land drainage systems of Crete and Babylon, the aqueducts of Rome are art in their own rights. Technology and art don’t exclude each other.  By seeing the aesthetic aspects of our basic technologies and bringing art to bear on the construction of future systems, a new “technic”ology can develop."
Ventilation Series,"In order to support the health and well-being of our visitors and staff, and in line with recommendations from public health officials regarding COVID-19, the exhibition Light and Language: Nancy Holt with A.K. Burns, Matthew Day Jackson, Dennis McNulty, Charlotte Moth, and Katie Paterson will now open in Spring 2021."
Dark Star Park,"The shadow patterns on the ground indicate that the poles and spheres are actually tangent to each other, whereas perceptually they look as if they are either closer together or wider apart than the diameters of the spheres. The shadows cast by the poles and spheres line up with the steel-edged asphalt shadow patterns on the ground at approximately 9:32 a.m. on August 1 each year—the day in 1860 when William Henry Ross acquired the land that became Rosslyn—merging historical time with the cyclical time of the sun."
Pipeline,"The Visual Arts Center invited me there to experience the vast Alaskan Environment, anticipating that the experience would generate an idea for an artwork. For ten days I roamed the land looking at various sites, including the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. In July I returned to Alaska and constructed a work, which evolved from the strongest of my main initial impressions of that place."
Pipeline,"What emerged was Pipeline—evoking the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, an $8 billion system that has twelve pump stations, eight hundred miles of pipe, and 1- billion barrels of oil. This enormous pipeline relentlessly snakes through mountain ranges as it precariously channels warm primordial fuel through the frozen landscape from one end of Alaska to the other.  More frequently than most people realize, breakdowns occur—pipes crack or rust out, oil spills."
Sun Tunnels,"Sun Tunnels marks the yearly extreme positions of the sun on the horizon—the tunnels being aligned with the angles of the rising and setting of the sun on the days of the solstices, around June 21st and December 21st. On those days the sun is centered through the tunnels, and is nearly center for about ten days before and after the solstices."
Sun Tunnels,"The four concrete tunnels are laid out on the desert in an open X configuration eighty-six feet long on the diagonal. Each tunnel is eighteen feet long, and has an outside diameter of nine feet and two-and-a-half inches and an inside diameter of eight feet with a wall of thickness of seven-and-a-quarter inches. A rectangle drawn around the outside of the tunnels would measure sixty-eight-and-a-half feet by fifty-three feet."
Sun Tunnels,"Cut through the wall in the upper half of each tunnel are holes of four different sizes—seven, eight, nine, and ten inches in diameter. Each tunnel has a different configuration of holes corresponding to stars in four different constellations—Draco, Perseus, Columba, and Capricorn. The sizes of the holes vary relative to the magnitude of the stars to which they correspond. During the day, the sun shines through the holes, casting a changing pattern of pointed ellipses and circles of light on the bottom half of each tunnel. On nights when the moon is more than a quarter full, moonlight shines through the holes casting its own paler pattern. The shapes and positions of the cast light differ from hour to hour, day to day, and season to season, relative to the positions of the sun and moon in the sky."
Sun Tunnels,"In 1974 I looked for the right site for Sun Tunnels in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. What I needed was flat desert ringed by low mountains. It was hard finding land which was both for sale and easy to get to by car. The state and federal governments own about two-thirds of the land, the rest is owned mainly by railroads and large ranches, and is usually sold in one-square-mile sections. Fortunately, the part of the valley I finally chose for Sun Tunnels had been divided up into smaller sections, and several of these were for sale. I bought forty acres, a quarter of a mile square."
Sun Tunnels,"My land is in a large, flat valley with very little vegetation—it’s land worn down by Lake Bonneville, an ancient lake that gradually receded over thousands of years. The Great Salt Lake is what remains of the original lake now, but it’s just a puddle by comparison. From my site you can see mountains with lines on them where the old lake bit into the rock as it was going down. The mirages are extraordinary: You can see whole mountains hovering over the earth, reflected upside down in the heat. The feeling of timelessness is overwhelming."
Sun Tunnels,"An interminable string of warped, arid mountains with broad valleys swung between them, a few waterholes, a few springs, a few oasis towns and a few dry towns dependent for water on barrels and horsepower, a few little valleys where irrigation is possible...a desert more vegetationless, more indubitably hot and dry, and more terrible than any desert in North America except possibly Death Valley...Even the Mormons could do little with it. They settled its few watered valleys and let the rest of it alone."
Sun Tunnels,"In the surrounding area are old trails, crystal caves, disused turquoise, copper, and tungsten mines, old oil wells and windmills, hidden springs, and ancient caves. A nearby cave, coated with centuries of charcoal and grease, is filled with at least ten feet of residue—mostly dirt, bones, and artifacts. Out there a “lifetime” seems very minute. After camping alone in the desert awhile, I had a strong sense that I was linked through thousands of years of human time with the people who had lived in the caves around there for so long. I was sharing the same landscape with them. From the site, they would have seen the sun rising and setting over the same mountains and ridges."
Sun Tunnels,"The closest settlement is four miles away in Lucin, Utah. It’s a village of ten people; nine are retired and one works for the railroad. Until the demise of the railroad, Lucin and Tacoma (ten miles west) were thriving towns of a few hundred people, with hotels, cafes, barber shops, saloons. Tacoma is completely leveled now. Except for a sign, there is no way of telling that a town had once been there. Lucin has only one of its old buildings left standing. The next closest town, Montello, Nevada (pop. sixty), twenty-two miles west, went through a similar process, but is more intact: even a few of the original sheds, made of interlocking railroad ties covered with sod roofs, still exist."
Sun Tunnels,"The idea for Sun Tunnels came to me while I was in Amarillo, Texas, in 1973, but it wasn’t until the next year that I bought land for the work. Then in August of 1975 I went back to Utah and began working. I didn’t know anyone there, and was totally outside any art-world structure. I was one individual contacting other individuals. But by the time Sun Tunnels was finished, I had spent one year in Utah and had worked with two engineers, one astrophysicist, one astronomer, one surveyor and his assistant, one road grader, two dump truck operators, one carpenter, three ditch diggers, one concrete mixing truck operator, one concrete foreman, ten concrete pipe company workers, two core-drillers, four truck drivers, one crane operator, one rigger, two cameramen, two soundmen, one helicopter pilot, and four photography lab workers."
Sun Tunnels,"In making the arrangements and contracting out the work, I became more extended into the world than I’ve ever been before. It was hard involving so many people in making my art. Since my two grants covered only one-third the total cost, and I was financing the other two-thirds with my own money, I had to hustle quite a bit to keep down the cost and get special consideration. Making business deals doesn’t come easy to me; it was often very exasperating. I don’t have any romantic notions about testing the edges of the world that way. It’s just a necessity. It doesn’t lead to anything except the work."
Sun Tunnels,"I went out West for the first time in 1968 with Robert Smithson and Michael Heizer.1
 As soon as I got to the desert, I connected with the place. Before that, the only other place that I had felt in touch with in the same way was the Pine Barrens in southern New Jersey,2
 which only begins to approach that kind of Western spaciousness."
Sun Tunnels,"I went back West for a few months every year. In 1969 I began a series of “Buried Poems,”3
 using some desert sites. Then in 1972 I made Missoula Ranch Locators4
 in Montana in a very different kind of Western landscape—very expansive, but greener and more “scenic” than the desert. The site is right for the work; different things can be seen through each of the eight Locators—a mountain, a tree, a flat plain, a ranch house, etc. Through the work, the place is seen in a different way. The work becomes a human focal point, and in that respect it brings the vast landscape back to human proportion and makes the viewer the center of things. In both works I used a natural ordering; Missoula Ranch Locators is positioned on the points of the compass, Sun Tunnels on the angles of the solstices at the latitude of the site."
Sun Tunnels,"When I was making projected light works in New York, the idea of working with the actual projected light of the sun began to intrigue me. I put cut-outs in my window and models on my roof in New York, so I could watch the light and shadow change hour by hour, day by day. In Utah I made drawings and worked with scale models and large hoops in the desert, trying out different lengths, diameters, and placements, and doing photographic studies of the changes in light and shadow. I consulted with an astrophysicist5
 at the University of Utah about the angles of the solstices at the latitude of my land. Because the land had irregular contours, and the earth was not a perfect sphere, we had to calculate the height of the distant mountains and ridges and, using a computer, readjust the solstice angles from this date. The angles we arrived at formed an “X,” which worked as a configuration for the tunnels. Using a helioscope set for the latitude of the site, it was possible to study the changes in light and shadow in my model for every hour during every day of the year."
Sun Tunnels,"“Time” is not just a mental concept or a mathematical abstraction in the desert. The rocks in the distance are ageless; they have been deposited in layers over hundreds of thousands of year. “Time” takes on a physical presence. Only ten miles south of Sun Tunnels are the Bonneville Salt Flats, one of the few areas in the world where you can actually see the curvature of the earth. Being part of that kind of landscape, and walking on earth that has surely never been walked on before, evokes a sense of being on this planet, rotating in space, in universal time."
Sun Tunnels,"By marking the yearly extreme positions of the sun, Sun Tunnels indicates the “cyclical time” of the solar year. The center of the work becomes the center of the world. The changing pattern of light from our “sun-star” marks the days and hours as it passes through the tunnel’s “star-holes.” The positioning of the work is also based on star-study: the surveyor and I were only able to find True North by taking our bearings on the North Star—Polaris—as it ovals around the North Pole because of the earth’s movement."
Sun Tunnels,"I wanted to bring the vast space of the desert back to human scale. I had no desire to make a megalithic monument. The panoramic view of the landscape is too overwhelming to take in without visual reference points. The view blurs out rather than sharpens. Through the tunnels, parts of the landscape are framed and come into focus. I chose the diameter, length, and distance between the tunnels based on the proportions of what could be seen of the sky and land, and how long the sun could be seen rising and setting on the solstices."
Sun Tunnels,"In the desert, scale is hard to discern from a distance. Mountains that are five or ten miles away look deceptively close. When the Sun Tunnels is seen from four miles away, it seems very large. Closer in, a mile or so away, the relational balance changes and is hard to read. The work is seen from several angles on the road in; at times two of the tunnels line up exactly head on and seem to disappear. Seen from a side angle, the two tunnels in front can totally overlap and cancel out the ones in the back."
Sun Tunnels,"The color and substance of the tunnels is the same as the land that they are a part of, and the inner matter of the concrete—the solidified sand and stone—can be seen on the insides of the holes, where the “core-drill” cut through and exposed it. In that kind of space the work had to have a substantial thickness and weight, which was only possible with concrete. The rims are wide enough to frame the space from long distances, and the weight (twenty-two tons per tunnel) gives the work a feeling of permanence."
Sun Tunnels,"In the glare of the desert sunlight, I want to turn away from the sun, rather than contemplate it. When the sunlight is all around me like that, I only become conscious of it when it is edged by shadow. The sunlight pours in wherever there are holes in the tunnels. Because of the seven- and-a-quarter-inch thickness of the holes, the shape of the light that reaches the bottom of the tunnels is usually a pointed ellipse, but there are times when the sun is directly over a hole and a perfect circle is cast. Day is turned into night, and an inversion of the sky takes place: stars are cast down to Earth, spots of warmth in cool tunnels."
Sun Tunnels,"Moonlike crescents of light form inside the rims of the tunnels. They elongate in the early and late hours of the day, and disappear altogether when the tunnels are in full shadow inside, which occurs at a different time on one diagonal of the “X” than it does on the other. (Around the summer solstice this happens about 12:30 and 3:30.) On days when the clouds come and go, there is a dimming, a darkening, and then a brightening of the areas of light."
Sun Tunnels,"When the sun beats down the site, the heat waves seem to make the earth dissolve, and the tunnels appear to lose their substance—they float like the mirages in the distance. Around the time of the solstices, when the sun rises and sets through the tunnels, it glows bright orange on the tunnel walls."
Sun Tunnels,"At night, even a quarter moon can cast a pattern of light. The moonlight shines through the holes in different positions and with a different intensity than the sunlight does. In the moonlight the tunnels seem to glow from within their own substance, the rims of the tunnels forming crescents in the night. As you move through the tunnels, the moon and stars and planets can be lined up and framed through each hole. Looking up through the holes on a bright night is like seeing the circles of light during the day, only inverted."
Sun Tunnels,"The moon was formed billions of years ago. But no one is sure just how. Space was full of dust and rocks in those days, and these came together to form the Earth. Perhaps when the Earth was first formed, part of it broke loose and became the Moon.
—Isaac Asimov, The Moon"
Sun Tunnels,"In choosing the constellation for the holes, I wanted only those with stars of several different magnitudes, so that I could have holes of different diameters. Depending on which of the twelve astronomical charts I consulted, the number and positions of the stars in the constellations varied, increasing my options considerably. Each constellation had also to have enough stars, and to encompass the top half of a tunnel with some holes at eye level on each side, so that the viewer could look through the eye-level holes from the outside and see through the holes on the other side of the tunnel. With those criteria there were only a few constellations that I could use, and from them I chose Draco, Perseus, Columba, and Capricorn. Together, they encompass the globe—Columba is a Southern Hemisphere constellation which slips over the edge of the horizon for a short time each year, but can’t be seen because of the dense atmosphere near the earth. Capricorn is visible in the fall and early winter, and is entered by the sun at the winter solstice. Draco and Perseus are always visible in the sky."
Sun Tunnels,"The work was constructed in several stages. From True North in the center of the site, the surveyor and I staked out the solstice angles that the astrophysicist had calculated. But before digging the first hole for the foundations, I wanted actually to “see” a solstice. Delaying the work until the end of December meant delaying the work until the spring, because the ground would be frozen. In the interim before the winter solstice, I hired a road gravelling crew and graveled a three-quarter-mile road out to the site. On December 22nd we watched the sunrise and sunset and the data checked out."
Sun Tunnels,"I was in the pipe yard every day while the tunnels were being constructed.6
 I made templates to mark the hole positions on the inner and outer pipe forms, so that the steel that goes into the wall of the pipe—the re-bar cage—could be cut wherever there was going to be a hole. Steel rings were welded around the areas where the holes would be cut to increase the strength. The pipe form had to be blocked on one end to make the ends of the tunnels smooth, not recessed."
Sun Tunnels,"The core drilling was done with hollow, cylindrical drill heads ringed with diamonds. As a hole was cut, the edge of the drill head would slice through the wall, taking the core of concrete out with it as the drill was removed. When the core drilling was finished, I hired four large low-boy trucks to haul the tunnels, and a sixty-ton crane, which went the two hundred miles out to the site at twenty-five m.p.h., to lift them onto the foundations."
Sun Tunnels,"The local people and I differ on one point: if the land isn’t too good for grazing, or if it doesn’t have water, or minerals, or shade, or interesting vegetation, then they think it’s not much good. They think it’s very strange when I camp out at my site, although they say they’re glad I found a use for that land. Many of the local people who came to my summer solstice camp-out had never been out in that valley before. So by putting Sun Tunnels in the middle of the desert, I have not put it in the middle of their regular surroundings. The work paradoxically makes available, or focuses on, a part of the environment that many local people wouldn’t normally have seen."
Pine Barrens,"“A Piney is a person who’s lived in the Pines all their life and seldom ever goes to a city, because we don’t care for the city. There’s too many people there. We like to be more alone, you know. I’m not cutting the city down or nothin’ like that, but here you got open spaces, you got a tree to go to if you know what I mean, and stuff like that.”"
Pine Barrens,"The Pine Barrens is a wilderness of sand and pine trees 1,000 square miles in area in the central part of southern New Jersey. It’s the forgotten land of the northeastern urban belt: New York is an hour and 45 minutes away to the north, Philadelphia to the west, Atlantic City to the south. It’s full of sandy roads (some of them old stagecoach routes) that go nowhere, just dead-ending among the scrub or dwarf pine. Sometimes there’s an old shack at the end, or a blueberry field or a cranberry bog. In the central region there are three towns: Hog Wallow (population 25), Jenkins (45), and Chatsworth (300). There are deer and other wildlife. Branches of the Wading River and natural bogs of still dark water break up the surface of the land. There people call themselves “Pineys.” Most have lived there for generations, and even today few of the young people leave. Pineys stay pretty much to themselves, taking pride in their reclusiveness. Stories and myths and strange notions of city life have grown up among them."
Pine Barrens,"Since I was eight years old I’ve been making trips to the Pine Barrens. Last spring I went there every day looking for land to buy to make a work. I didn’t find an available site that was right for my sculpture, but the landscape, as a whole, was very absorbing. I felt compelled to bring a sense of that place to other places. I figured I’d do this by filming various aspects of the land without a single person in it. In this way the landscape is no longer a mere backdrop for human activity; it begins to assert its own presence. I also wanted the Pineys themselves to talk about the place without my voice-over being heard. Documentaries have depended a great deal on explanatory narration by “voices of authority.” The attitude is usually falsely objective and educational—a kind of downward look at “interesting places with colorful people.” I wanted to make a film that would unfold intrinsically from the place and its inhabitants."
Pine Barrens,"I began by shooting a few rolls of film with my Bolex and by doing some interviews with the Pineys. I looked at the film rushes, listened to the tapes, and perceived the place at one remove. I have been shooting film in the landscape since 1968. Some of the footage I have made into films: Swamp in 1971 (with Robert Smithson) and a videotape, Underscan, in 1974, which is about a place—my aunt’s home in New Bedford, Massachusetts—with an audio track of her own words taken from letters. Some ideas from these pieces and other areas of my art were at work in the Pine Barrens, while at the same time the barrens were continuously re-involving me and giving me a flow of new film ideas. I kept to the same pattern—filming one day in the Pine Barrens, looking at rushes the next day in New York. Traveling back and forth from the Barrens to the city made both places emerge in my mind in a very focused and detached way."
Pine Barrens,"As I shot, the structure of the film and the rhythm of the shooting emerged spontaneously from the landscape. The camera was always moving through space; the visual imagery was constantly in flux. Sometimes the filming was done from the car windows, sometimes I walked and filmed. There are two circular pans, one handheld, one from a tripod. Among the images are tall pines foreshortened by being shot from below from a moving prone position, and close-in shots of branches actually being pushed away by the camera as I walked through the thick pine woods. The sun flashes off the lens causing one scene to bleach in rhythm with my walking as I go down a deer trail. In another scene the edge of a car window divides the frame and intersects with the constantly changing horizon as the car moves. There’s a section of the film with fifty individual pine trees, one after the other. But even there the camera is in motion: with each tree the camera was in a still position for two seconds, turned off (causing a flash frame), and then moved slightly, the same tree being shot again for another two seconds. The motion of the camera is accentuated by the stillness. Overall, the filming ratio was about five takes for every one used in the film."
Pine Barrens,"I rented a Nagra and taped the music played locally by Bill Patton’s Pine Barrens Trio at the Green Bank Inn, which is an old unpainted shingle house, hardly discernible as a bar from the outside; a small swinging sign saying BEER is the only clue. The Pineys and the hunters come from the woods to hang out there. The music is plain American country. I continued to interview Pineys: a cranberry bog owner, a woman who runs a saw mill, three rangers, a hunter, a woman who runs a sand quarry, a gas station owner, a couple who owned the country store in Chatsworth, a housewife, a woman bartender, and four or five woodsmen (men who make their living entirely from the woods, Pineys in the purest sense). A total of seven hours of interviews were taped; I used about fifteen minutes of them in my film."
Pine Barrens,"The dialogue finally used in the film is concentrated; it is interspaced with the sounds of the place: birds, airplanes, crunching sand, wind, rippling water, general woods ambience. Each piece of dialogue is one of several versions of the same statement. Since the Pineys have lived isolated for generations and have an unusual way of speaking, clarity of local accent was a factor in the selection. Though you don’t see the Pineys and their individual identities aren’t revealed in the soundtrack, there is a sense of their presence throughout the film. The psychology of the place comes through in their language, and in the film the rhythm of their speech counterpoints the visual imagery. Without sync sound there’s a great deal more leeway in sound editing; word and image are not visually connected, so new unions of the verbal and visual can be made. At times crazed laughter, strange tales, or ironic intonations undercut the seeming beauty of this desolate, barren land."
Pine Barrens,"Since Pineys have a solid verbal take on their land, they liked being interviewed. From the beginning they took a lot of interest in the film. They’ve asked me to show it to them in their firehouse, and I may also show it at the Green Bank Inn. Since Pine Barrens evolves partially from the landscape itself, and partially from the people and their responses to their own natural environment, the audience for the film will extend much further than the art world."
